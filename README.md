# Creating filters with Image Processing Algorithms| Python OpenCV
In this project, we created several filters using various image processing techniques. 
We have created many filters:
* The first filter involves highlighting a specific object based on colour and changing the background. There are two variations:
  * Object with a blurred background
  * Object with a grayscale background
* In the second and third filter, we used the very popular [Canny Edge detection algorithm](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html) for line drawing.
* In the fourth filter, we tried to obtain a pencil sketched image of a given picture.
* In the fifth filter we created a water colour like effect. Here, we used the very popular unsupervised learning alogrithm, [K-Means Clustering](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d1/d5c/tutorial_py_kmeans_opencv.html).
* In the sixth filter, we created a cool cartoon like effect.
* In the final filters, we used colormap transformations with different color schema.

# Packages and libraries used:

* Numpy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
